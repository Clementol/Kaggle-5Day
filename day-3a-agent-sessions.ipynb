Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of AI in healthcare. There are constant new developments. Here are some of the key areas and recent trends you'll find:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **The Trend:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of just *screening* existing compounds, generative AI models can now *create* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties.\n*   **How it Works:** These AI models learn the rules of chemistry and molecular structure and can then \"generate\" novel molecules that are predicted to be effective against a specific disease target, have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), and are less likely to have side effects.\n*   **Examples:** You'll see news about companies using these techniques to design novel antibiotics, antivirals, and even treatments for complex diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification:**\n\n*   **The Trend:** AI is becoming much better at identifying the underlying biological mechanisms (targets) of diseases.\n*   **How it Works:** AI analyzes vast amounts of multi-omics data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) combined with patient data and scientific literature to pinpoint specific proteins or pathways that, when modulated, could lead to a therapeutic effect.\n*   **Impact:** This helps researchers focus their efforts on the most promising targets, rather than wasting time on less relevant ones.\n\n**3. Accelerated Pre-clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **The Trend:** AI is speeding up the evaluation of drug candidates before they even reach human trials.\n*   **How it Works:**\n    *   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models can predict how well a drug candidate will work and identify potential toxicity issues earlier in the process, reducing the number of costly failures.\n    *   **\"Digital Twins\" and In Silico Trials:** Researchers are developing AI-powered simulations that can mimic biological systems or even \"digital twins\" of patients to test drug responses without using as many physical lab experiments or animal models.\n    *   **Optimizing Drug Properties:** AI can suggest modifications to a molecule to improve its solubility, stability, or ability to cross biological barriers.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **The Trend:** AI is proving highly effective at identifying new uses for drugs that are already approved for other conditions.\n*   **How it Works:** AI can scan databases of existing drugs and compare their molecular structures and known biological activities against the characteristics of different diseases. This is often much faster and cheaper than developing a new drug from scratch.\n*   **Examples:** This has been particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, where AI helped identify existing antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs that could be repurposed.\n\n**5. Integrating Diverse Data Sources:**\n\n*   **The Trend:** The power of AI in drug discovery is amplified by its ability to integrate and make sense of increasingly diverse and complex datasets.\n*   **What it Includes:** This includes not just biological and chemical data, but also real-world evidence from electronic health records, patient-reported outcomes, and even wearable sensor data.\n\n**Key Players and Recent News:**\n\nYou'll often see news from companies like:\n\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Known for its platform that uses AI and automation to map biology and discover treatments.\n*   **Exscientia:** One of the leaders in using AI to design novel drug candidates, with several drugs entering clinical trials.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Uses its AI platform to identify novel targets and accelerate drug discovery.\n*   **Atomwise:** Specializes in using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Focuses on end-to-end AI-driven drug discovery and development.\n*   **Big Pharma:** Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, etc.) are heavily investing in and partnering with AI drug discovery firms.\n\n**What to look for in recent news:**\n\n*   **Announcements of new AI-discovered drug candidates entering clinical trials.**\n*   **Partnerships between AI drug discovery companies and larger pharmaceutical firms.**\n*   **New research papers detailing novel AI methodologies for drug design or target identification.**\n*   **FDA approvals or breakthroughs related to AI-designed drugs.**\n\nThe pace of innovation is incredibly high, so staying updated involves regularly checking industry news sources.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification** in drug discovery. This is a really crucial area where AI is making a significant impact.\n\nLet me elaborate on what \"enhanced target identification\" means and why it's so important:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore we dive into AI, let's clarify what a \"drug target\" is. In essence, it's a specific molecule in the body (usually a protein or gene) that a drug is designed to interact with. The goal is for the drug to either:\n\n*   **Inhibit:** Block the activity of a harmful protein or pathway.\n*   **Activate:** Stimulate a beneficial protein or pathway.\n*   **Modulate:** Fine-tune the activity of a target.\n\nFor example, in cancer therapy, a target might be a protein that helps cancer cells grow and divide uncontrollably. A drug would then be designed to inhibit that protein's function.\n\n**The Challenge of Traditional Target Identification:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying and validating drug targets has been a slow, laborious, and often serendipitous process. It typically involved:\n\n*   **Deep scientific expertise:** Years of research by highly specialized biologists and chemists.\n*   **Hypothesis-driven research:** Starting with a specific idea about what might be causing a disease and then testing it.\n*   **Extensive lab work:** Conducting numerous experiments, often involving cell cultures and animal models.\n*   **High failure rates:** Many promising hypotheses and initial targets don't pan out due to unforeseen complexities in biological systems.\n\n**How AI is Enhancing Target Identification:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, is transforming this process by leveraging its ability to analyze vast, complex datasets and uncover patterns that are invisible to human researchers. Here's how:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** This refers to the integration and analysis of different types of biological data generated from a single sample. Key \"omics\" include:\n        *   **Genomics:** Studying an organism's complete set of DNA.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** Studying the complete set of RNA transcripts in cells.\n        *   **Proteomics:** Studying the complete set of proteins expressed by an organism.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Studying the complete set of metabolites (small molecules) in cells or organisms.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms can sift through these massive datasets, identifying correlations between genetic variations, protein expression levels, RNA activity, and metabolic changes that are associated with a particular disease. This can reveal novel pathways or molecules that are implicated in the disease but might not have been obvious through traditional research.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP):**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can \"read\" and understand vast amounts of unstructured text data, such as scientific literature, patents, clinical trial reports, and even social media discussions about health.\n    *   **AI's Role:** NLP can extract key information about disease mechanisms, potential drug targets, and the relationships between different biological entities. It can identify emerging trends, forgotten research, or subtle connections that a human researcher might miss.\n\n3.  **Integrating \"Real-World Evidence\" (RWE):**\n    *   **What it is:** This includes data from electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, patient registries, and data from wearable devices.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can analyze this real-world data to identify patient populations with specific disease characteristics, understand disease progression, and spot early indicators or risk factors. This can point to new targets that are relevant to how diseases manifest in the broader population, not just in controlled lab settings.\n\n4.  **Network Biology and Systems Biology Approaches:**\n    *   **What it is:** This views biological systems not as isolated components but as interconnected networks.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can model these complex biological networks, understanding how different proteins, genes, and pathways interact. By perturbing these networks computationally, AI can predict the downstream effects of targeting a specific node (a potential target) and identify the most impactful interventions.\n\n5.  **Predictive Modeling for Target Prioritization:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once potential targets are identified, AI can help rank them based on various criteria.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can predict the \"druggability\" of a target (how likely it is that a molecule can be designed to interact with it effectively), its potential efficacy, its likelihood of causing adverse effects, and its relevance to specific patient subgroups. This allows researchers to focus their limited resources on the most promising targets.\n\n**Impact and Future Implications:**\n\n*   **Faster Discovery:** Significantly shortens the time from understanding a disease to identifying potential therapeutic avenues.\n*   **More Novel Targets:** Uncovers targets that might have been overlooked by traditional methods, opening up new therapeutic possibilities.\n*   **Precision Medicine:** Helps identify targets that are specific to certain patient populations or even individual patients, paving the way for more personalized treatments.\n*   **Reduced Costs:** By identifying more promising targets earlier, AI can help reduce the immense costs associated with drug development by minimizing late-stage failures.\n\nIn essence, AI empowers researchers to move beyond single-gene or single-protein hypotheses and understand diseases as complex, interconnected systems. This holistic view, fueled by data and advanced analytics, is critical for tackling some of the most challenging diseases we face today.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification is quite diverse, encompassing both established pharmaceutical giants and specialized AI biotechnology companies.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
